These are some scripts I made for my own use to pull editions of magazines from their respective web sites into eBooks. I used to run these on my FreeNAS server, but the server has been down for a while and I'm reading the articles on the web sites now. Perhaps these are useful for someone. I expect they will need to be updated to make them work again. The Economist script is a modification of the standard Calibre script. The other scripts are mine, and at least at the time there were the only ones for these sites.
